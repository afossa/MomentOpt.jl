 Solve a global optimization problem with MomentOpt.jl 
 For theortic background see : https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S1052623400366802

 Let K be a basic semialgebraic compact set and f a polynomial function. We are intersted in 
 the global optimization problem
 
 min f(x)
     x∈K

An equivalent formulation of this problem as Generalized Moment Problem is given by

min <μ,f>
    <μ,1> = 1
     μ∈M(K)

The optimal measure in the Generalized Moment Problem above will be atomic and each atom will be a global minimizer 
of f on K.
