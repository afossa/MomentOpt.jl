# MomentOpt.jl - Conic Relaxations for Generalized Moment Problems

MomentOpt.jl is a Julia package to model Generalized Moment Problems and to approximate solutions via conic relaxations. 

The two main ideas of MomentOpt.jl are 1) to enable users to easily formulate their problem in terms of measures and 2) to compute approximations based on different conic relaxations.
